                owned by corporations, governmental agencies, partnerships, trusts, religious organizations,
                schools, or cooperative housing arrangements, or installed on apartment buildings or any other
                type of buildings or premises not used by individual homeowners as their residence. For such
                purchasers or entities to which this coverage does not apply, the warranty period will be (10)
                years following the date of original installation. This warranty applies to the following Harvey
                vinyl window products only: double hung, single hung, casement, awning, hopper, rolling, picture
                and designer shapes. Bay and bow
                configurations are also covered; however wood components are limited to a 10 year warranty.
                Acoustic vinyl windows are limited to a 10 year non-transferable warranty. This warranty does
                NOT apply to garden windows.
                 
                The statements contained herein set forth the only express warranties of the above products. Any
                implied warranties imposed by law, such as implied warranties of merchantability or fitness for
                a particular purpose, are limited in time to the duration of the above express warranties. The
                manufacturer shall not be liable to the buyer for incidental or consequential damages for breach
                of any written or implied warranty.
                 
                Some states do not allow limitations on how long an implied warranty lasts, and some states do
                not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above
                limitations or exclusions may not apply to you. This warranty gives you specific legal rights,
                and you may have other rights which vary from state to state.</p>
